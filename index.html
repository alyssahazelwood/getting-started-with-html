  <b>Intro to HTML</b>
  
  <p>HTML = hypertext markup language <br>
  It is the basis for everything on the web <br>
    HTML is made up of: text content, markup, references to other docs,<br>
    and links to other pages <br>
    <br>
    Markup is the part of the HTML that you don't see. <br>
    Content is what displays on a webpage <br>
    An element is everything within a set of HTML tags.
  </p>
  <h2>Tags</h2>
  <p>Tags communicate to the computer what type of element you are inputting <br>
  We learned the following tags: <br>
break <br>
<b>bold</b><br>
<em>italics</em><br>
paragraph and break<br>
span and div<br>
Image <br>
Attribute and Anchor<br>
<br>
If a tag that requires an end tag is missing one, the remainder of the text will follow the<br>
instruction to the end of the text.
<br>
A void tag does not require an end tag.
<br>
Tags can be "inline" or "block"<br>
A block tag creates a box around the content--needs an end tag.  A box can have height and width.

  </p>
  
  <h3>Images and Attributes</h3>
  <p>You can insert images with the image tag or links with the attributes tag.<br>
  An attribute is the property of an HTML tag.
